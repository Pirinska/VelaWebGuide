During this procedure, stitches are placed in the cervix to keep it closed, providing additional support to the uterus. It's a vital measure taken to improve the chances of carrying a pregnancy to term, helping many women avoid the complications associated with premature birth.</p>

It involves the removal or destruction of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to address issues such as heavy menstrual bleeding. This surgery offers relief to women who suffer from heavy or prolonged periods, improving their quality of life and comfort, but it's generally considered only after other treatment options have been explored and proven unsuccessful.</p>
